# HAND_GESTURE
🤟 Real-Time Hand Gesture & Facial Expression Tracking System

A real-time computer vision application that detects and tracks hand gestures and facial landmarks using OpenCV and MediaPipe, serving as the foundation for an AI-powered Sign Language Recognition System.

📌 Overview

Communication is one of the biggest challenges for deaf and mute individuals. This project aims to bridge that gap by developing a real-time vision system capable of tracking hand gestures and facial expressions. The extracted features can later be used to train deep learning models for Indian Sign Language (ISL) recognition and emotion-aware communication.

The current version focuses on accurate landmark detection, tracking, and visualization, providing the core pipeline for future AI-based gesture classification.

🎯 Objectives
Detect and track both hands in real time.
Detect and track facial landmarks.
Display a live visualization of hand and face landmarks.
Build a modular pipeline for future deep learning integration.
Provide a foundation for sign language recognition and assistive communication.
✨ Features
✅ Real-time webcam input
✅ Detects up to 2 hands simultaneously
✅ Tracks 21 landmarks per hand
✅ Tracks 468 facial landmarks
✅ Real-time visualization
✅ FPS monitoring
✅ Clean and modular code structure
✅ Ready for AI model integration
